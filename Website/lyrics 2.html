    <h3>Lyrics</h3>
    <pre>
        How can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day

Somebody tell Doja Cat that I'm tryna indulge in that
In my grey tracksuit, see the bulge in that
See the motion clap when you're throwin' it back (when you're throwin' it back)
These females plannin' on doin' me wrong, so I'm grabbin' a 'dom out the Trojan pack

Post the location after we're gone, can't slip and let them know where we're at
I don't know about you, but I value my life (but I value my life)
'Cause imagine I die (die), and I ain't made a hundred Ms yet
There's so much things I ain't done yet like fuckin' a flight attendant, huh

I don't party, but I heard Cardi there, so fuck it, I might attend it
Gotta kick back sometimes and wonder
How life woulda been if I never did take them risks and woulda I prospered?
Floatin' and I won't go under, been outta town for a month
Absence made the love grow fonder
UK rap or UK drill, gotta mention my name if you talk 'bout the genre (alright)

Ho-ho-how can I be homophobic? (My bitch is gay)
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way (way)
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day

Ho-ho-how can I be homophobic? My bitch is gay
Hit man in the top, try see a man topless, even the stick is gay
Huggin' my bruddas and say that I love them, but I don't swing that way
The mandem celebrate Eid, the trap still runnin' on Christmas day
