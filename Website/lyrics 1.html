        Got a link in Brum
        If it weren't for the accent (Benji)
        Got a link in Brum, met her at the Bullring
        She would be a ten if
        It weren't for the accent

        If you're wondering what's the attraction
        Babe, spin 'round and show 'em the mad ting
        I'm a simple man, I'm a London boy
        Drink Henny and mix with cola
        Day off, course I'm not sober
        Just called bro like

        "What's the vibe? What's the agenda?"
        Been high since like November
        I like my tings nice and slender
        Said that we met, I don't quite remember
        I don't remember, what's the agenda?
        Been high since like November
        I like my tings nice and slender
        Said that we met, I don't quite remember
        I don't remember

        Got me a belly in lockdown
        Need me a PT, but I got loud, it's TT
        Told her I love her, but she don't believe me
        Looking all caramel white like RiRi
        Prefer life with racks in my bank
        She likes LV, not Anthony Wang
        Thinks I'm the guy, but I actually am
        And when I'm stressed out, I wrap me a gram
        Got a link in Brum, met her at the Bullring
        She would be a ten if

        It weren't for the accent

        I been high since like November
        I like my tings nice and slender

        Two girls that I can't get back
        Pissed, I'm not tryna lose like that
        Got Nina, she a speaker
        Is it me or these hundred bags?
        Should've seen what I paid in tax
        I'm back on track, I'll be paid in cash
        Ayo, Spence

        Which one over there do you wanna take back?
        That one with the dress and shoes on (Okay)
        Party in West, come with Ye

        Then left like Buffon (Left like Buffon)
        And I don't rock Yeezy nor three stripes
        I can't put Loubs on all this space
        You can get lost in the dust like Elon
        Still no tracks, been signed to a label
        Million streams in a year, I'm grateful
        This girl wanna late night sushi

        Said I'm lit, but she acting boujee
        Walk in the dance and they're asking
        "Who's he?" (Like, who's he? Who's he?)
        I can't think when I'm moving loose
        Can't think when I'm moving loosely
        Got a link in Brum, met her at the Bullring
