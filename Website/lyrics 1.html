Got a link in Brum
If it weren't for the accent (Benji)
Got a link in Brum, met her at the Bullring
She would be a ten if
It weren't for the accent

If you're wondering what's the attraction
Babe, spin 'round and show 'em the mad ting
I'm a simple man, I'm a London boy
Drink Henny and mix with cola
Day off, course I'm not sober
Just called bro like

"What's the vibe? What's the agenda?"
Been high since like November
I like my tings nice and slender
Said that we met, I don't quite remember
I don't remember, what's the agenda?
Been high since like November
I like my tings nice and slender
Said that we met, I don't quite remember
I don't remember

Got me a belly in lockdown
Need me a PT, but I got loud, it's TT
Told her I love her, but she don't believe me
Looking all caramel white like RiRi
Prefer life with racks in my bank
She likes LV, not Anthony Wang
Thinks I'm the guy, but I actually am
And when I'm stressed out, I wrap me a gram

Two girls that I can't get back
Pissed, I'm not tryna lose like that
Got Nina, she a speaker
Is it me or these hundred bags?
Should've seen what I paid in tax
I'm back on track, I'll be paid in cash
Ayo, Spence

Which one over there do you wanna take back?
That one with the dress and shoes on (Okay)
Party in West, come with Ye

Then left like Buffon (Left like Buffon)
And I don't rock Yeezy nor three stripes
I can't put Loubs on all this space
You can get lost in the dust like Elon
Still no tracks, been signed to a label
Million streams in a year, I'm grateful
This girl wanna late night sushi

Said I'm lit, but she acting boujee
Walk in the dance and they're asking
"Who's he?" (Like, who's he? Who's he?)
I can't think when I'm moving loose
Can't think when I'm moving loosely
